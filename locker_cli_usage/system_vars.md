One of the key features of Locker CLI is its ability to streamline the integration of secrets into application workflows. Users can effortlessly retrieve all necessary secrets and export them as system variables directly for seamless application execution. This functionality significantly enhances operational efficiency by eliminating the need for manual intervention in managing secret configurations.

Suppose we are about to run a Django application and we need to provide necessary configuration (like MySQL username, MySQL password...) securely, this single command can help us do the work
```
locker secret set && python manage.py runserver
```
